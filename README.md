# Patrick Lynch Bookmarks App Website

Milestone 3
One Project: Data Centric  Development - Code Institute

This project was built to be used either by the user or myself, to store or bookmark urls. 
The building of the project came from a need to organize my own bookmarks, 
which become bloated and cluttered. In the pursuit of learning to code, 
shopping online or just finding articles Im Interested In, I found myself bookmarking 
urls on google or copying and pasting links and texting them to myself as a way of saving when using my mobile. 
So I wanted to build something that fulfilled all of these needs. If it I could build 
something useful to me. I was  sure It would be useful to other users.
