# Patrick Lynch Bookmarks App Website

Milestone 3
One Project: Data Centric  Development - Code Institute

This project was built to be used either by the user or myself, to store or bookmark urls. 
The building of the project came from a need to organize my own bookmarks, 
which become bloated and cluttered. In the pursuit of learning to code, 
shopping online or just finding articles Im Interested In, I found myself bookmarking 
urls on google or copying and pasting links and texting them to myself as a way of saving when using my mobile. 
So I wanted to build something that fulfilled all of these needs. If it I could build 
something useful to me. I was  sure It would be useful to other users.

## Demo
A live demo can be found [here]

## UX

This website was designed with mainly the colors blue yellow and white.
The intention to be easy on the eye for the user and myself. 
I wanted to create an app for myself and other users where I can easily store, 
edit, delete and update bookmarks as well as assign each bookmark to a category.  
I began using this app for myself as soon as the very basic functionality was set up. 
I used it to store useful links for building the app which gave me a good feel for what 
worked and what did not. What was a good user experience and what was not.
You can Search through the bookmarks and find them using the category name, a word from the description, 
the date or month it was added or a word from the url itself. I also wanted this to be a site where all 
bookmarks are added by each user and are shared among the community as I feel links to useful 
websites when learning a new skill can be a valuable resource. It could also be used to store a shopping 
wish list and for many other purposes.  Each user also has their own unique bookmarks on a user page 
and only they can edit or delete their own bookmarks. I myself as the admin could also directly delete 
them from the database.

## Wireframe mockups
  Wireframing for this project was done the same as I like to do all my projects with a pencil and paper. Some of the forms pages would be near Identical on both mobile and larger devices so this was written on the sketch rather than sketching It out twice.
