# Patrick Lynch Bookmarks App Website

Milestone 3
One Project: Data Centric  Development - Code Institute

This project was built to be used either by the user or myself, to store or bookmark urls. 
The building of the project came from a need to organize my own bookmarks, 
which become bloated and cluttered. In the pursuit of learning to code, 
shopping online or just finding articles Im Interested In, I found myself bookmarking 
urls on google or copying and pasting links and texting them to myself as a way of saving when using my mobile. 
So I wanted to build something that fulfilled all of these needs. If it I could build 
something useful to me. I was  sure It would be useful to other users.

## UX

This website was designed with mainly the colors blue yellow and white.
The intention to be easy on the eye for the user and myself. 
I wanted to create an app for myself and other users where I can easily store, 
edit, delete and update bookmarks as well as assign each bookmark to a category.  
I began using this app for myself as soon as the very basic functionality was set up. 
I used it to store useful links for building the app which gave me a good feel for what 
worked and what did not. What was a good user experience and what was not.
You can Search through the bookmarks and find them using the category name, a word from the description, 
the date or month it was added or a word from the url itself. I also wanted this to be a site where all 
bookmarks are added by each user and are shared among the community as I feel links to useful 
websites when learning a new skill can be a valuable resource. It could also be used to store a shopping 
wish list and for many other purposes.  Each user also has their own unique bookmarks on a user page 
and only they can edit or delete their own bookmarks. I myself as the admin could also directly delete 
them from the database.
