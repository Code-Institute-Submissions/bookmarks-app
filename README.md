# Patrick Lynch Bookmarks App Website

Milestone 3
One Project: Data Centric  Development - Code Institute

This project was built to be used either the user or myself, to store or bookmark urls. 
The building of the project came from a need to orginize my own bookmarks, which become bolated and clutered. In the pursuit of learning to code, shopping online or just finding articles Im Interested In, I found my self bookmarking urls on google or copying and pasted links an texted to my self when using my phone. So I wanted to build something that fufilled all of these needs. If it I could build something usefull to me itIm sure It would be usefull to others.
